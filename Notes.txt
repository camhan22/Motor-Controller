System can handle 65A continously with 150A peak currents
Operating voltage is 12-48V (Limited by MOSFET driver)
Accepts an I2C single byte that is arranged as follows:

DSSSSSSS

Where D is the direction (0 or 1)
S is the duty cycle from 0-100% (This is checked by the software to ensure it is within bounds)

Returns an integer that tells how the controller is doing. If faults are present, there are seperate status codes for each failure
