   MOTOR CONTROLLER CODE 2020
   BY: CAMERON HANSON
   REVISION: 3.0
   RELEASE DATE: 10/18/2021

   RELEASE NOTES:
   V3.0: Added CRC check for incoming data to ensure that the data was actually valid, this avoids a problem where spotty connections can lead to the system randomly jumping and going out of control
   V2.3: Added status LED indication to help diagnose problems without a computer being attached. Also added a DEADBAND to the throttle to avoid wasting power
   V2.2.2: Added code to check that duty cycle was within bounds of 0-100%. If it is beyond the bounds, it gets set to the appropriate bound
   V2.2.1: Fixed a bug with the reset driver where PB4 was not being set as an output and the reset process was allowed to be interrupted
   V2.2: Fixed a bug that would have caused the kart to slam to a stop if a false reset code was sent when no controllerFault existed and restructured the code to be more readable
   V2.1: Added controllerFault line from driver chip to code and added some controllerFault codes to be put to the main controller if the driver chip is controllerFaulted
   V2.0: Changed controller to a more robust driver that handles more features of the H-Bridge. The microcontroller just converts the I2C into a PWM and controllerDirectionection for the driver as well as checking controllerFaults)

   THINGS TO UPDATE:

   Definitions:
   Controller - Arduino chip (ATTINY4313)
   Driver - MOSFET driver chip (A4956 motor driver)
   Main Controller - Sends the I2C commands to the motor controller (Acts as the master for all motor controllers) (In my application, it will be a raspberry Pi 4)
