all parameters are calculated from the graph in this folder unless otherwise specified.

Internal Resistance (R): 12v/131A (Stall current, needed because free running has back-emf at play) = 0.09160 Ohm
Torque Constant (Kt): 2.41 Nm (stall torque) / 131A (Stall Current) = 18.39695e-3 Nm/A
Back-emf constant (Kv) = 12V (from zero current and input voltage at 12V) / 558.15629415 rad/s = 21.49935e-3 V*s
Friction Coefficient (B): (Kt*i)/w = (18.39695e-3 * 2.7 (free running current))/558.15629415 rad/s = 8.89926e-5 N*m/s
Internal Inductance (not Calculated): 5.90e-5 H


NOTE: back-emf and torque constant are very close to each other. It is a difference of only 0.60927%, for ballpark estimates, I can use ke=kb.


Here is an article that shows the coefficients for a model of the motor:

This appears to validate the parameters I got from the graph
